* Error when lazyheap is turned on

* Add locks for dataset

* Add bigmemory dataset


* Uniform grid for massive dimensionality data (sparse vector from boost?)
    having done that we can make splitting more efficient
    because currently it has to look in 3^d cubes, and 
    for d>10 it is equivalent to looking at all points 
    I would use external library

* Refactor to bagging datasets, improve rejection sampling


* Error to GNGAlgorithm


* Exceptions


* Check delete in GNGNode
