To remember:
   * dataset is taking examples, not just copying (performacne/memory issues)
   * graph is not thread safe - we have to lock it and unlock it (performance issues)

For production code:
   * uncommend IFDEF for RcppInterface. Commented out for syntax parsing in Eclipse (STUPID ECLIPSE)


* Add bigmemory dataset, or/and reading csv

* Minor:
   Check all constants alpha and beta in particular

* Uniform grid for massive dimensionality data (sparse vector from boost?)
    having done that we can make splitting more efficient
    because currently it has to look in 3^d cubes, and 
    for d>10 it is equivalent to looking at all points 
    I would use external library
