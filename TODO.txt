To remember:
   * dataset is taking examples in set data, not just copying (performacne/memory issues)
   * graph is not thread safe - we have to lock it and unlock it (performance issues) - tricky! (already had a bug in
   exportToGrahpML)
	* both locking mechanism for dataset and graph are STRANGE and NONINTUITIVE - for performance issues
	so locking has to be performed by hand using lock/unlock
   * If matrix is passed from R as ssetData, it has to be deleted from R. In other cases it is copied

For production code:
   * uncommend IFDEF for RcppInterface. Commented out for syntax parsing in Eclipse (STUPID ECLIPSE)


* Add bigmemory dataset, or/and reading csv

* Minor:
   Check all constants alpha and beta in particular

* Uniform grid for massive dimensionality data (sparse vector from boost?)
    having done that we can make splitting more efficient
    because currently it has to look in 3^d cubes, and 
    for d>10 it is equivalent to looking at all points 
    I would use external library
