#Growing Neural Gas in R

Package to be included in GMuM.R project. Currently under heavy rewritting.

###General
------

Fast implementation of the GNG algorithm in C++/Rcpp/R using also Fiser optimization [FGNG: A fast multi-dimensional growing neural gas implementation] (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231213009259). This algorithms is widely used for dynamic clustering problems, often occuring for example in robotics. This version should be stable.
Alpha build, which means unfriendly building, and not fully implemented interface for the end user, 
but I reckon that it is already consitutes a practical tool for data analysis.

###Installation
-----------
Because it is a very early version, building isnt straightforward. You need to have installed libboost libraries and necessary packages in R (i.e. rgl, parallel). Now go to the reposity directory and enter:
```bash
    make rcpp
```

##Examples
-----

Growing Neural Gas is a clustering algorithm. For theoretical details please see (in polish) this file [growing-neural-gas.pdf](https://www.dropbox.com/s/glol7j54qg2vnuh/praca_roczna_draft.pdf). Algorithm in action:

##Scripts
------

* Load sample data
```Matlab
    source("gng.r") #load package
    GNGCreateServer() 
    #wait at least 2 seconds (booting)
    sv<-new("GNGClient")
    sv$addExamples(preset="sphere",preset_size=100000) #load sphere point distribution
    sv$runServer()
    #wait at least 2 seconds
    GNGVisualise() #plot points
```

And you should get something like this:

* Load obj file
```R
source("gng.r")
GNGSetParams(max_nodes=25000)
GNGCreateServer() #notice that servers runs in a parallel manner
Sys.sleep(2.0)
sv<-new("GNGClient")
sv$loadObj("data/models/buddha2.obj") #provided you have got model here
sv$run()
iteration<-0
GNGVisualise()
sv$getAccumulatedError() #retrieve error value
sv$getNumberNodes() #get nodes
```
